# Assignment 7 - Using Exceptions & Pickles

# Introduction & Problem Statement
The task set forth in this assignment was to create a script that utilized both exceptions and pickles and finding a way to integrate both into the same script. For this assignment, I decided to continue the trend of using a menu of numerical options, using the exception function to ensure proper input, and using pickling and unpickling to save and store data in an external file. 

# Creating the Menu
First I decided to model my menu off of a Dog Adoption Database. To do so, I created the menu with the following options: (1) Adding Dogs to the List; (2) Displaying the Current Dogs; (3) Unpickle & Reload List of Dogs from File; (4) Pickle and Save to File; (5) Exit Program. See Figure 1 for Menu display. User input was collected as a string input and saved as Variable UserInput.
